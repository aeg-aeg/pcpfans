# The goal here is to live-migrate PCP temporary files from places
# they may have been stashed away in previous versions.  This is
# important as they may be in-use by instrumented applications and
# we want to avoid loss of service as a result of the switch.
#

# The new place ... this should match the setting in /etc/pcp.conf
# _after_ the installation
