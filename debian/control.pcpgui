Description: Visualisation tools for the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit
 The PCP GUI package primarily includes visualisation tools for
 monitoring systems using live and archived Performance Co-Pilot
 (PCP) sources.
 .
 These tools have dependencies on graphics libraries which may or
 may not be installed on server machines, so PCP GUI is delivered
 as a separate package to the core PCP infrastructure.
