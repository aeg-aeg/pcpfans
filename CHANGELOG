    - Switch MMV PMDA to use dynamic namespace interfaces, which resolves
      long-standing spurious EAGAIN error on reconfiguration.

    - Reverted rc scripts default start/stop settings back to how
      it was in 2.9.3-1, for Debian bug #544350. On Red Hat platforms,

    - Move Infiniband and Cluster PMDAs to a stand-alone packages
    - Trim the set of RPM files marked as %config to just those
      that are actually likely to be edited (rpm -qlcv pcp pcp-libs).

pcp-3.0.0 (9 October 2009)
    - PMDA_INTERFACE_4 and the support of dynamic subtrees of the PMNS
      where the PMDA (not PMCD) maintains knowledge of the PMNS.
    - RPM packaging split into pcp, pcp-libs and pcp-libs-devel
      pcp-libs is common - it's required by pcp and by pcp-libs-devel but
      pcp and pcp-libs-devel can be installed with or without each other.
    - Added separate specific licenses for the new subpackages,
      particularly pcp-libs, which is LGPL.
    - Added ldconfig %post and %postun scriptlets for -libs
    - Don't explicitly require Infiniband libs, since they're libs and RPM
      figures it out
    - No need to explicitly BuildRequire gcc-c++ libstdc++-devel
    - Add BuildRequires on perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker
    - Remove explicit ia64 Requires: libunwind
    - Preserve generated gram.tab.c in several places since debuginfo needs it
    - Create %{_localstatedir}/run/pcp and ship it (so it'll be removed)
    - Use %doc in spec for CHANGELOG COPYING INSTALL README VERSION.pcp pcp.lsm
    - Tweak configure to move PCP_BINADM_DIR out of /usr/share, into /usr/lib.
      Arch dependent binaries should not be installed below /usr/share.
    - Delete unneeded "explicit script interpreter" in several places
      to keep rpmlint happy
    - Remove setuid from pmpost, not needed (and not in debian either)
    - Nuke the migrate_pcp_var_dir, script and it's %post scriptlet
    - Default "chkconfig off" for all PCP services (retain settings on upgrade)
    - Clean-up and simplify the %post scriptlets (rather dramatically)
    - Don't ship static libraries in Fedora, we have the debug package for that
    - Install .NeedRebuild, add to %files and remove crud from %post scriptlets
    - Added %changelog in RPM spec and moved %files to end before %changelog
    - Move demos, examples and demo PMDAS to the libs-devel package since they
      are not used for production (but are useful for devel and needed for QA).
    - Don't install trace demo binaries since src is installed anyway
    - Reconciled build/rpm/pcp.spec.in with build/rpm/pcp_fedora.spec
    - Integrated RPM packaging support for perl-PCP-PMDA and perl-PCP-MMV
      (but perl-PCP-Logsummary is not currently shipped in RPM packages)
    - RPM build requires perl(ExtUtils::MakeMaker) rather than
      perl-extutils-makemaker (this is the standard notation)
    - For easier upgrades, the perl PMDAs only really require pcp >= package
      version (until we change or extend an API).
    - ReplacePmnsSubtree fix bad signal handling botch (affecting MMV PMDA)
    - Fix pmcd.timezone metric such that value updates on daylight savings
      (or other timezone) changes.

    - from Michal Kara: rc will rebuild PMNS if root_* files newer than root
    - add the roomtemp PMDA for measuring temperatures using the 1-Wire
      serial network ans sensor technology from Dallas Semiconductor
    - zero network.tcpconn values before counting them in /proc/net/tcp
      (Michal Kara's original code was correct - markgw busted it!)

      Laurent Demailly <L@Demailly.com>
    - minor surgery on apache PMDA to link with -lpcp_http
    - minor fix diagnostic from __pmLogRead
    - as reported by Alexander L. Belikoff <abel@vallinor4.com>, it was
      not possible to disable the primary logger via changes to the
      /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/control file ... this has been fixed
    - as reported by Alan Bailey <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>, the assumption
      that /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/control was version 1.1 was implicit 
      ... this is now documented and the pmlogger_* scripts will warn
      if the deprecated version 1.0 format is used accidently
    - from Michal Kara: fix mem leak in apache PMDA
    - from Michal Kara: install /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/Makefile
      (src is in src/pmlogctl/Makefile.install). This provides pre-processing

    - fix bug #814989 where disk.all.* not summed correctly (if the sard
      patch has been applied to running kernel)
    - with the sard patch applied to the kernel, disk.all metrics were
      being summed as the total of disk.partitions and disk.dev metrics,
      resulting in approximately twice the rate of disk I/O for the
      disk.all metrics
    - added more disk metrics and update help text
    - the "cpu" instance domain is now dynamic and supports any number of CPUs
    - fixed pmie rc and pmie_{check,daily} scripts
    - a bunch of places were using $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmcd/pmcd.conf
      as the path to pmcd.conf (which is correct). Others were using
      /etc/pmcd.conf (which is only correct on IRIX).
    - merged IRIX/Linux versions of pmsocks
    - mimic the IRIX xconfirm behaviour more closely, pv 817289
    - pv:817367 Handle SIGCHLD from xconfirm problem on Linux
    - minor changes in error messages to make them less IRIX-centric
      and hence more sensible for Linux

      with pmafm replay when pcp also installed.
    - updated man page text for platform-agnostic descriptions.
    - fix 817880 pmafm remove does not list all files
    - src/pmie/GNUmakefile Fix busted sed translation of the control
      file so the logfiles (and hence directories) are ...pmie/<hostname>
      rather than pmie<hostname>
    - renamed all Makefiles to GNUmakefile
    - makefile surgery to allow multiple RPMs to be built from one src tree
    - fixes to src/pmcd/pmdaproc.sh to not use test -e
    - pv:815326 fix pcp linux /usr/share/magic doesn't detect pmie config
    - pv:818381 fix pmie_check fails esp integration

      (needed to avoid warnings when installing on redhat7.1)
    - add GNUmakefile.install for all PMDAs, installed in each PMDA dir
    - fix src/pmdas/weblog/server.sh to use quotes on -d that was breaking
      when parameter empty.
    - pv:807561 change pmprobe -i and -I semantics to call pmGetInDom
      rather than using the returned indom from pmFetch
    - add hinv.machine for oview to use
    - change the cpu instance domain to use the numa names if they are
      present on the machine, else revert to cpuX syntax
    - numerous fixes so the src RPM builds on all platforms
    - pv:824382 - xfs block metrics were scaled incorrectly
    - add support for /proc/slabinfo metrics (mem.slabinfo.*)
    - add new "process" and "mounts" PMDAs, contributed by Alan Baily
    - added GPL copyrights to process and mounts src, fixed makefiles
      to extract domain number from stdpmid and added install targets,
      and small change to ignore comments in conf files.
    - added hinv.pagesize (uses the getpagesize(2) system call)
    - fixed bug #825229 where rpm upgrade would clobber root pmns for PMDAs

    - fixes so the build works if pcp is not already installed
    - minor security fix to pcp.spec.in (force mode 644 for .NeedRebuild)
    - make sure the src RPM builds correctly (LSRCFILE issues from LinuxWorld)
    - fix for bug #797756, upgrade from pcp2.1.6 to any newer version leaves
      pcp chkconfig off and the name space does not get rebuilt.
    - extended the weblogs PCP agent so it can report proxy/squid
      http servers, and added assorted http cache statistics.
    - fixed the Cisco router PCP agent (it was broken in pp1.3).
    - add support for disk stats in 2.4.x kernels with "disk_io" field
      in /proc/stat (only used when sard patch is not installed)
    - if the pcp-pro package (SGI proprietary) is installed, all libpcp
      clients on linux are now "authorized" to monitor IRIX systems that

    - update all rc scripts and {pmlogger,pmie}_{check,daily} scripts
      to use the new rc-proc.sh functions. Remove the /etc/sysconfig
      stuff entirely (it was not being used anyway).
    - fix for #795934 : after rpm -U, pcp is chkconfig off. It turned
      out that an upgrade executes the %post _and_ the %preun scripts,
      which resulted in pcp being chkconfig'd on then off again.
    - fix pmie rc scripts so they work, are chkconfig friendly,
      and cope with _and_ without pmieconf (which is in pcp-pro).
      Also install /var/pcp/config/pmie/config.default as a simple example
      to monitor the load average and report to syslog. The pmie
      daemon is chkconfig off by default.
    - default run levels for pmcd and pmie (daemon) are now 2345, for SUSE
    - reconcile troff and groff differences in man page sources
    - fix for bug #797049 use strftime(%z) to determine timezone offsets
      w.r.t. daylight savings
    - portability surgery on src/libpcp_trace, and add new pmtracecounter()
      function, see pmtracebegin(3) for details.
    - reconcile pcp.env and pmcd.options from IRIX
    - fix for bug #797048 update-magic does not fully remove old entries
      before adding new, hence the magic file would grow after each upgrade
    - other minor reconciliation work with IRIX
    - fix build environment to allow proper handling of compressed man pages
    - add support for RPM version 4.
    - add support for add kernel.{all,percpu}.syscall metrics
      (requires kernel patch)
    - fixed for bug #797164: potential SEGV due to calling realloc on a 
      misused pointer - src/pmdas/weblog/weblog.c
    - use realpath(3) to resolve devices in /proc/mounts for filesys.* metrics


pcp-2.1.8-2 (released 30 June 2000)
    - fix for bug #793871 pmlogger_check fails after redhat upgrade
      (because PCP entries in /usr/share/magic were clobbered)
    - also install /var/pcp/pmdas/linux/pmdalinux (as a non-DSO
      agent for debugging and profiling purposes).
    - added pmda.uname (uname -a) and pmda.version (linux pmda version)
      metrics. The pmda.uname metric is needed by the "pcp" command.
    - fix for #789025 fix to ensure rpm --verify succeeds immediately
      after an install, and other errors in pmlogger_check
    - released with ACE 1.3 (MR 19 Jul 2000)

pcp-2.1.7 (internal release for testing)
    - merged changes from IRIX for multiple namespace support in
      pmdaproc.sh
    - parameterized path to pmcd.conf and pmcd.options to avoid
      having to move these files in IRIX. Use PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH and
      PCP_PMCDOPTIONS_PATH respectfully.
    - add new error define PM_ERR_LOGFILE (reconciled from IRIX)
    - conditional pragma for pmGetConfig (not used in linux)
    - use if defined(HAVE_OBJECT_STYLE) to guard __pmCheckObjectStyle
      since it's not used in linux (reconciled with irix code)
    - correct logic used to scan for pmlogger pid in pmlogger_check
      in case where pmlogger exits prematurely, part of #789025
    - added -Wall to default CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
    - added xfs metrics (needs kernel support else no values available)
      extracted from /proc/fs/xfs/stat
    - added nfs (version 3) metrics, same names as on irix, bug #789669
    - fix instance domain for kernel.percpu.interrupts, bug #790372

pcp-2.1.6 (released 3 May 2000)
    - released with ISE 1.2 (MR 25 May 2000)
    - released with ISEMAIL 1.0 (MR 24 May 2000)
    - this is the version shipped with SGI ProPack1.3
    - change use of __clone to pthread_create for portability
    - add support for raid disk stats (previously ignored)
    - fix for bug #789425 pmie suspect behaviour with "delta" keyword
    - add support for devfs style scsi disk names
    - fixed a problem where nfs stats were always showing NFSv3 stats
      rather than NFSv2 stats. We are not (yet) supporting NFSv3 stats.

pcp-2.1.5 (released 12 April 2000)
    - released with SGI ACE 1.2 (MR 19 Apr 200)
    - fix bug #786743 filesys metrics are wrong
    - fix potential segfault bug in timezone handling
    - tolerate SUSE's location of magic file different to Redhat's
    - tolerate no chkconfig on SUSE (use %postinstall create rc symlinks)

pcp-2.1.4 (released 15 Feb 2000)
    - fix for segfault src/pmdas/linux/pmda.c on linuxppc, found by
      Dale F. Brantly <dale.brantly@sgi.com>
    - fix build error in src/pmclient, was trying to use pmgenmap
      without /etc/pcp.env, also found by Dale.
    - setlinebuf(stdout) for all clients that loop
      (fixes a buffering problem on alpha-linux).
    - fixed some missing "{" in conditional variable assignments
      in src/pmie/etc_init.d_pmie (found by lstep@free.fr)
    - changed use of pmgenmap in build for pmclient and
      pmkstat to be consistent (found by lstep@free.fr)
    - don't assume clock tick rate is 100/second. Use the CLK_TCK macro
      instead. Rearrange arithmetic in src/pmdas/linux/pmda.c where we
      divide by CLK_TCK to avoid truncation in conversions from jiffies
      to milliseconds.
    - return "no values available" rather than PM_ERR_APPVERSION for
      the metrics disk.{all,dev}.{read,write,total}_bytes since these
      are not available on systems without the "sard disk patch".  This
      is now consistent with requests for disk.partitions.* metrics.

pcp-2.1.3 (released with 2.1.4)
    - released with ISE 1.0 (MR 1 Mar 2000)
    - added hinv.map.scsi metric as a map of SCSI devices (if any)
    - added disk.dev.{read,write,total}_bytes
    - filter devpts from filesys.* metrics to avoid FPE errors
    - added support for new style Apache configuration file and
      "silent" install to weblog scripts

pcp-2.1.2 (released with 2.1.4)
    - released with SGI ACE 1.0
    - fixed date field in LSM
    - install pmiestats.h for pmieconf
    - renamed /var/pcp/config/pmafm/pcp-col to
      /var/pcp/config/pmafm/pcp
    - added network.{ip,icmp,tcp,udp} metrics
      extracted from /proc/net/snmp
    - fixed shell syntax error in pmlogger_daily(1)
      (changed test -l to test -f)
    - fixed problem with definition of __psint_t on 64bit machines
    - fixed timezone problem with daylight saving

pcp-2.1.1 (released 7 Dec 1999)
    - initial pcp-2.1.1 open source release
