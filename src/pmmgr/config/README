This is the default built-in configuration directory for pmmgr.
See man pmmgr(1) for details of the individual files that are
read to extract configuration lines.  Other files in this directory
are for documentation / examples.

The default built-in configuration items for pmmgr are almost sufficient
to act as a system's primary pmlogger and pmie.  The exceptions are the
actual enablement of pmlogger & pmie, and their auto-generated configuration,
which are enabled by some empty files here.

Additional possible but non-default configurations are given in .example*
files here.  Rename them to drop the .example* filename extension to 
activate them.
