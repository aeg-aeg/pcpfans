=head1 NAME

pmdakvm - Linux virtualisation performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pmdakvm> is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
metric values from the Linux KVM virtualisation subsystem.

Unlike many PMDAs it dynamically enumerates its metric hierarchy,
based entirely on the contents of /sys/kernel/debug/kvm.

=head1 INSTALLATION

If you want access to the names and values for the kvm performance
metrics, do the following as root:

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm
	# ./Install

If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm
	# ./Remove

B<pmdakvm> is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when
the agent is installed or removed.

=head1 FILES
