Default Context
metric: sample.colour

Oneline Text: Metrics with a "saw-tooth" trend over time

Oneline InDomText: Instance domain "colour" for sample PMDA

Help Text: This metric has 3 instances, designated "red", "green" and "blue".

The value of the metric is monotonic increasing in the range N to
N+100, then back to N.  The different instances have different N
values, namely 100 (red), 200 (green) and 300 (blue).

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once
for each pmFetch() to this metric and/or sample.mirage and/or
sample.mirage_longlong.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

Help InDomText: Universally 3 instances, "red" (0), "green" (1) and "blue" (3).
