.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmhostname
[\fIhostname\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmhostname
reports the name of the host
.I hostname
as returned by
.BR gethostbyname (3N).
.PP
If
.I hostname
is not specified, then the local host name
is retrieved using
.BR gethostname (2)
and this is than passed to
.BR gethostbyname (3N).
.PP
.B pmhostname
provides a service for shell scripts that
mimics the logic used by Performance Co-Pilot applications
when trying to determine the official name of a host.
.PP
If
.BR gethostbyname (3N)
fails, the input host name (either
.I hostname
or the result from calling
.BR gethostname (2))
is reported.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (4).
