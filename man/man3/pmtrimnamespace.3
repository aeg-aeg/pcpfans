.TH PMTRIMNAMESPACE 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmTrimNameSpace\f1 \- prune a performance metrics name space
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
int pmTrimNameSpace(void);

.SH DESCRIPTION
If the current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
context
corresponds to a version 1 archive log of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
performance metrics (as collected
by
.BR pmlogger (1)
.BR -V1 ),
then the currently loaded
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), is trimmed to exclude
metrics for which no description can
be found in the archive.
The PMNS is further trimmed to remove empty subtrees that do not contain any
performance metric.
.PP
Since PCP archives usually contain some subset
of all metrics named in the default PMNS,
.B pmTrimNameSpace
effectively trims the application's PMNS to contain only the
names of the metrics in the archive.
.PP
Since PCP 2.0, 
.B pmTrimNameSpace 
is only needed for dealing with version 1 archives.
Version 2 archives actually store the "trimmed" PMNS. 
.PP
Prior to any trimming,
the PMNS is restored to the state as of the completion of the last
.BR pmLoadASCIINameSpace (3)
or
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3),
so the effects of consecutive calls to
.B pmTrimNameSpace
with archive contexts are
.B not
additive.
.PP
If the current PMAPI context
corresponds to a host
and a
.BR pmLoadASCIINameSpace (3) 
or
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3) 
call was made,
then the PMNS reverts to all names loaded into the PMNS
at the completion of the last
.BR pmLoadASCIINameSpace (3)
or
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3),
i.e. any trimming is undone.
.PP
On success,
.B pmTrimNameSpace
returns zero.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOPMNS\f1
you must have loaded a PMNS using
.BR pmLoadASCIINameSpace (3)
or
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3)
before calling
.B pmTrimNameSpace
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT\f1
the current PMAPI context
is invalid
