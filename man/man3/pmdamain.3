.SH DESCRIPTION
For Performance Metric Domain Agents 
.RB ( PMDA (3)) 
using the binary PDU protocols to communicate with
.BR pmcd (1),
the routine
.B pmdaMain
provides a generic implementation of the PDU-driven main loop. 
.PP
.B pmdaMainLoop
and
.B pmdaMainLoopFreeResultCallback
implemented an earlier version of this functionality.  Both functions will be
removed in a later release and should not be used.
.PP
The arguments that are now encapsulated in
.B pmdaExt
that were passed to 
.B pmdaMainLoop
include the 
.I name
of the PMDA (used only in error messages) and the file descriptors
.I infd
and
.I outfd
used to receive and send PDUs to the
.BR pmcd (1)
process.
.PP
.I dispatch
describes how to process each incoming PDU. It
is a vector of function pointers, one per request PDU type,
as used in the DSO interface for a PMDA, namely:

        unsigned int    pmapi_version : 8; /* PMAPI version */

.PP
This structure has been extended to incorporate the multiple interface versions
that have evolved over time.
For
.BR pmdaMain,
.I dispatch->domain
and
.I dispatch->status
are ignored.  The 
.I comm.pmda_interface
field is used to determine the interface used by the PMDA.  Setting this field
to
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_2
or
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_3
will force 
.B pmdaMain
to use the callbacks in the
.I version.two
structure.
A setting of
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_4
or
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_5
will force 
.B pmdaMain
to use the callbacks in the
.I version.four
structure.  Any other value will result in an error and termination of
.BR pmdaMain .
.PP
Note that the use of
.B dispatch
as the interface between the
.BR pmcd (1)
and the methods of the PMDA allows each PMDA to be implemented as
though it were a DSO, with
.B pmdaMain
providing a convenient wrapper that may be used to convert from the
DSO interface to the binary PDU (daemon PMDA) interface.
.PP
.B pmdaMainLoop
provided two additional callbacks, 
.I check
and
.IR done .
If not null, 
.I check 
is called after each PDU is received (but before it was processed), and 
.I done
is called after each PDU is sent.  
If
.I check
returns a value less than zero (typically PM_ERR_AGAIN),
the PDU processing is skipped and
in most cases the
function value is returned as an error PDU to
.BR pmcd (1)
\- this may be used for
PMDAs that require some sort of deferred connection or reconnect
protocols for the underlying sources of performance metrics, e.g. a DBMS.
The error indication from
.I check
is not passed back to
.BR pmcd (1)
in the cases where no acknowledgment is expected, e.g. for a PDU_PROFILE.
.PP
The callback
.I done
would typically be used to monitor termination conditions, or do
PMDA housekeeping required after
PDU processing.
.PP
These callbacks should now be set with 
.B pmdaSetCheckCallBack
and
.B pmdaSetDoneCallBack
when using
.BR pmdaMain .
.PP
One further callback mechanism is provided for handling the
.B pmResult
built for a PDU_RESULT in response to a PDU_FETCH request.  By default,
.B pmdaMain
will free the
.B pmResult
once the result has been sent to the
.BR pmcd (1).
For some PMDAs this is inappropriate, e.g. the
.B pmResult
is statically allocated, or contains a hybrid of pinned PDU buffer
information and dynamically allocated information.
.B pmdaSetResultCallback
may be used to define an alternative
.B callback
from
.BR pmdaMain .
The routine
.B pmdaMainLoopFreeResultCallback
has been replaced by 
.BR pmdaSetResultCallBack .
.PP
.B pmdaMain
executes as a continuous loop, returning only when an end of file
is encountered on the PDU input file descriptor.

and
.BR PMDA (3).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
These messages may be appended to the PMDA's log file:
.TP 25
.BI "PMDA interface version " interface " not supported"
The
.I interface
version is not supported by 
.BR pmdaMain .
.TP
.B Unrecognized pdu type
The PMDA received a PDU from 
.B pmcd
that it does not recognize. This may indicate that the
.B pmcd
process is using a more advanced interface than
.BR pmdaMain .
.PP
If the 
.BR PMAPI (3)
debug control variable
.RB ( pmdebug )
has the DBG_TRACE_LIBPMDA flag set then each PDU that is received is reported
in the PMDA's log file.
