.SH OVERVIEW

The PMWEBAPI interface is a binding of a subset of the PMAPI to the
web.  It uses HTTP as transport, REST as organizational style for
request/parameter encoding (the GET and POST methods are
interchangeable), and JSON as response encoding.  A context identifier
is used as a persistent way to refer to PMAPI contexts across related
web requests.  These context identifiers expire after a configurable
period of disuse.  Errors generally result in HTTP-level error responses.
An
.nh
.B Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
.hy
header is added to all JSON responses.

In addition, pmwebd may serve a subset of the graphite 0.9.2 web-api.

.SH CONTEXT CREATION: pmNewContext

To create a new web context identifier, a web client invokes:
.TP
.B /pmapi/context?local=ANYTHING
Creates a PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL PMAPI context.
.TP
.B /pmapi/context?hostname=STRING
.TP
.B /pmapi/context?hostspec=STRING
Creates a PM_CONTEXT_HOST PMAPI context with the given host name and/or extended
specification.  If the host specification contains a userid/password combination,
then the corresponding pmapi context operations will require HTTP Basic authentication
credentials with matching userid/password.
.TP
.B /pmapi/context?archivefile=ARCHIVE
Creates a PM_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE PMAPI context with the given file name.
.PP
In addition, the web client may add the parameter
.B &polltimeout=MMMM
for a maximum interval (in seconds) between expected accesses to the
given context.  This value is limited by pmwebd configuration, and is
a courtesy to allow pmwebd to free up memory earlier in case of sudden
web application shutdown.

If successful, the response from these requests is a JSON document of the form:

.SAMPLE
{ "context" : NNNNN }
.ESAMPLE

The number (a 32-bit unsigned decimal) is then used in all later operations.

.SH PMAPI OPERATIONS

The general form of the requests is as follows:
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/OPERATION
where
.TP
.B /pmapi
is the fixed prefix for all PMWEBAPI operations,
.TP
.B NNNNN
is a PMWEBAPI context number returned from a context-creation call, or
assigned permanently at pmwebd startup, and
.TP
.B OPERATION?PARAM1=VALUE2&PARAM2=VALUE2
identifies the operation and its URL-encoded parameters.  Some
parameters may be optional.

.SS METRIC METADATA: pmLookupName, pmLookupDesc, pmTraversePMNS_r

The general form of the requests is as follows:
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/_metric
Traverse the entire PMNS.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/_metric?prefix=NAME
Traverse the subtree of PMNS with the prefix NAME.
.PP
The response is a JSON document that provides the metric metadata
as an array.  For example:

.SAMPLE
{ "metrics": [ 
    { "name":"foo.bar", "pmID":PPPP, "indom":DDDD,
      "type":"32", "sem":"instant", "units":"MHz",
      "text-oneline":"foo bar", "text-help":"blah blah blah" },
    { "name":"foo.bar2", ... }
    ...
  ] }
.ESAMPLE

Most of the fields are self-explanatory.

.TP

.TP

an abbreviation of the metric semantic:

PM_SEM_COUNTER  "counter"
PM_SEM_INSTANT  "instant"
PM_SEM_DISCRETE "discrete"
.TE

.SS METRIC VALUE: pmFetch

The general form of the requests is as follows:
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/_fetch?names=NAME1,NAME2
Fetch current values for given named metrics.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/_fetch?pmids=PPPP1,PPPP2
Fetch current values for given PMIDs.
.PP
The response is a JSON document that provides the values for
all requested metrics, for all their instances.

.SAMPLE
{ "timestamp": { "s":SEC, "us":USEC },
  "values": [
        { "pmid":PPPP1, "name":"NAME1",
          "instances:" [
               { "instance":IIII1, "value":VALUE1 }
               { "instance":IIII2, "value":VALUE2 }
               ...
          ] },
        { "pmid":PPPP2, "name":"NAME2", ... }
        ...
  ] }
.ESAMPLE

Most of the fields are self-explanatory.  Numeric metric types
are represented as JSON integer or floating-point values.  Strings
are passed verbatim, except that non-ASCII values are replaced
with a Unicode 0xFFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER code.  Event type metrics
are not currently supported.

.SS INSTANCE DOMAINS METADATA: pmGetInDom, pmNameInDom, pmLookupInDom

The general form of the requests is as follows:
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_indom?indom=DDDD
List instances of the given instance domain.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_indom?name=NAME
List instances of the instance domain belonging to the named metric.
.PP
In addition, either query may be suffixed with:
.TP
.B &instance=IIII,JJJJ
Restrict listings to given instance code numbers.
.TP
.B &iname=INAME1,INAME2
Restrict listings to given instance names.
.PP

The response is a JSON document that provides the metric metadata
as an array.  For example:

.SAMPLE
{ "indom":DDDD,
   "instances": [
      { "instance":IIII, "name":"INAME" }
      ...
   ] }
.ESAMPLE

.SS INSTANCE PROFILE: pmAddProfile, pmDelProfile

.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_profile_reset?
These are not currently supported.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_profile_reset?indom=DDDD
These are not currently supported.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_profile_add?indom=DDDD&instance=IIII,JJJJ
These are not currently supported.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_profile_add?indom=DDDD&iname=IIII,JJJJ
These are not currently supported.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_profile_del?indom=DDDD&instance=JJJJ
These are not currently supported.
.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNN/_profile_del?indom=DDDD&iname=INAME1,INAME2
These are not currently supported.

.SS DERIVED METRICS: pmRegisterDerived

.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/_derive?name=NAME&expr=EXPRESSION
These are not currently supported.

.SS CONTEXT COPY: pmDupContext

.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/copy
These are not currently supported.

.SS CONTEXT CLOSE: pmDestroyContext

.TP
.B /pmapi/NNNNN/destroy
This is not likely to be supported, as it is destructive and would offer
a tempting target to brute-force attackers.  Instead, the pmwebd timeout
is used to automatically free unused contexts.
